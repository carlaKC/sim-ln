# SimLN

SimLN is a simulation tool that can be used to generate realistic 
payment activity on any lightning network topology. It is intentionally 
environment-agnostic so that it can be used across many environments - 
from integration tests to public signets. 

This tool is intended to serve developers who are familiar with 
lightning network development. It may be useful to you if you are:
* A protocol developer looking to test proposals. 
* An application developer load-testing your application.
* A signet operator interested in a hands-off way to run an active node. 
* A researcher generating synthetic data for a target topology.

## LN Implementation Support
* LND ‚úÖ
* CLN ‚úÖ
* Eclair ‚úÖÔ∏è
* LDK-node üèóÔ∏è

See our [tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/sim-ln/issues/26)
for updates on implementation support (contributions welcome!).

## Pre-Requisites
SimLN requires you to "bring your own network" to generate activity 
on. You will need:
* A [lightning network](#lightning-environments) connected with any 
  topology of channels.
* Access to execute commands on _at least_ one node in the network.
* Rust compiler [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* Protoc [installed](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation).

The simulator requires access details for a set of `nodes` that you
have permission to execute commands on. Note that the current version
of the simulator uses keysend to execute payments, which must be enabled as follows:
* LND: `--accept-keysend`
* CLN: enabled by default
* Eclair: `--features.keysend=optional`

## Getting Started

Once you have all the pre-requisites installed, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/sim-ln
cd sim-ln
```

Install the CLI: 
```
make install
```

To run the simulation, create a simulation file `sim.json` in the working directory (see [setup instructions](#simulation-file-setup) for details) and run:

```
sim-cli
```

Run `sim-cli -h` for details on `--data-dir` and `--sim-file` options that allow specifying custom simulation file locations.

### Simulation File Setup
The required access details will depend on the node implementation.  
* LND:

```
{
  "id": <node_id>,
  "address": <ip:port or domain:port>,
  "macaroon": <path_to_selected_macaroon>,
  "cert": <path_to_tls_cert>
}
```
* CLN:
```
{ 
  "id": <node_id>,
  "address": <ip:port or domain:port>,
  "ca_cert": <path_to_ca_cert>,
  "client_cert": <path_to_client_cert>,
  "client_key": <path_to_client_key>
}
```
* Eclair:
```
{ 
  "id": <node_id>,
  "base_url": <ip:port or domain:port>,
  "api_username": <username_to_authorize>,
  "api_password": <password_to_authorize>
}
```

Payment activity can be simulated in two different ways:
* [Random activity](#setup---random-activity): generate random activity on the `nodes` provided, 
  using the graph topology to determine payment frequency and size.
* [Defined activity](#setup---defined-activity): provide descriptions of specific payments that 
  you would like the generator to execute.

### Setup - Random Activity

To run the simulator with random activity generation, you just need to 
provide a set of nodes and the simulator will generate activity based 
on the topology of the underlying graph. Note that payments will only 
be sent between the `nodes` that are provided so that liquidity does 
not "drain" from the simulation. Every node specified will be eligible
to send and receive payments when running with random activity.

```
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "Alice",
      "address": "127.0.0.1:10011",
      "macaroon": "/path/admin.macaroon",
      "cert": "/path/tls.cert"
    },
    { 
      "id": "0230a16a05c5ca120136b3a770a2adfdad88a68d526e63448a9eef88bddd6a30d8",
      "address": "localhost:10013",
      "ca_cert": "/path/ca.pem",
      "client_cert": "/path/client.pem",
      "client_key": "/path/client-key.pem"
    },
    { 
      "id": "carol",
      "base_url": "127.0.0.1:8286",
      "api_username": "",
      "api_password": "eclairpw"
    }
  ]
}
```

Nodes can be identified by an arbitrary string ("Alice", "CLN1", etc) or
by their node public key. If a valid public key is provided it *must* 
match the public key reported by the node.

There are a few cli flags that can be used to toggle the characteristics 
of the random activity that is generated: 
* `--expected-payment-amount`: the approximate average amount that 
  will be sent by nodes, randomness will be introduced such that larger
  nodes send a wider variety of payment sizes around this expectation.
* `--capacity-multiplier`: the number of times over that each node in 
  the network sends their capacity in a calendar month, for example:
  * `capacity-multiplier=2` means that each node sends double their 
     capacity in a month.
  * `capacity-multiplier=0.5` means that each node sends half their 
    capacity in a month.
* `--fix-seed`: a `u64` value that allows you to generate random activities 
  deterministically from the provided seed, albeit with some limitations. 
  The simulations are not guaranteed to be perfectly deterministic because 
  tasks complete in slightly different orders on each run of the simulator. 
  With a fixed seed, we can guarantee that the order in which activities are
  dispatched will be deterministic.

### Setup - Defined Activity
If you would like SimLN to generate a specific payments between source 
and destination nodes, you can provide `activity` descriptions of the 
source, destination, frequency and amount for payments that you'd like 
to execute. Note that `source` nodes *must* be contained in `nodes`, 
but destination nodes can be any public node in the network (though 
this may result in liquidity draining over time).

Required fields:
```
"source": the payer
"destination": the payee
"interval_secs": how often the payments should be sent
"amount_msat": the amount of each payment
```

Optional fields:
```
"start_secs": the time to start sending payments
"count": the total number of payments to send
```

> If `start_secs` is not provided the payments will begin as soon as the simulation starts (default=0)

> If `count` is not provided the payments will continue for as long as the simulation runs (default=None)

The example simulation file below sets up the following simulation:
* Connect to `Alice` running LND to generate activity.
* Connect to `Bob` running CLN to generate activity.
* Dispatch 2000 msat payments from `Alice` to `Carol` every 1 seconds.
* Dispatch 140000 msat payments from `Bob` to `Alice` every 50 seconds.
* Dispatch 1000 msat payments from `Bob` to `Dave` every 2 seconds.
* Dispatch 10 payments (5000 msat each) from `Erin` to `Frank` at 2 second intervals, starting 20 seconds into the sim.

    }
  ]
}
```


Activity sources must reference an `id` defined in `nodes`, because the simulator can
only send payments from nodes that it controls. Destinations may reference either an
`id` defined in `nodes` or provide a pubkey or alias of a node in the public network.
If the alias provided is not unique in the public network, a pubkey must be used
to identify the node.

### Simulation Output

A summary of the results will be logged by the simulator. A full list of payments made with their outcomes
is available in `simulation_{timestamp}.csv` within the configured `{data_dir}/results`.

Run `sim-cli -h` for details on data directory (`--data-dir`) and other options including `--print-batch-size`
which affect how simulation outputs are persisted

## Lightning Environments
If you're looking to get started with local lightning development, we
recommend [polar](https://lightningpolar.com/). For larger deployments, 
see the [Scaling Lightning](https://github.com/scaling-lightning/scaling-lightning) 
project.

## Docker
If you want to run the cli in a containerized environment, see the docker set up docs [here](./docker/README.md)

## Advanced Usage - Network Simulation

If you are looking to simulate payments are large lightning networks 
without the resource consumption of setting up a large cluster of nodes,
you may be interested in dispatching payments on a simulated network.

To run on a simulated network, you will need to provide the desired 
topology and channel policies for each edge in the graph. The nodes in 
the network will be inferred from the edges provided. Simulation of 
payments on both a mocked and real lightning network is not supported, 
so the `sim_network` field is mutually exclusive with the `nodes` section 
described above.

The example that follows will execute random payments on a network 
consisting of three nodes and two channels. You may specify defined 
activity to execute on the mocked network, though you must refer to 
nodes by their pubkey (aliases are not yet supported).

        "max_htlc_size_msat": 50000,
        "cltv_expiry_delta": 80,
        "base_fee": 2000,

      }
    },
    {
      "scid": 2,

      "node_1": {
        "pubkey": "020a30431ce58843eedf8051214dbfadb65b107cc598b8277f14bb9b33c9cd026f",

        "base_fee": 3000,
        "fee_rate_prop": 5
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that you need to provide forwarding policies in each direction, 
because each participant in the channel sets their own forwarding 
policy and restrictions on their counterparty. 


### Random Activity Exclusions

When running with random activity (implied by the absence of `activity`),
every node listed in `sim_network` will be eligible to send and receive
payments. If you'd like to specify nodes in `sim_network` that do not
send/receive payments, you can include them in an `exclude` list:

```
{
  "sim_network": [ ... ],
  "exclude": [
    "020a30431ce58843eedf8051214dbfadb65b107cc598b8277f14bb9b33c9cd026f"
  ]
}
```

This is required for the case where you want to specify a channel that
will be used in the simulated network that is just responsible for 
forwarding payments, but does not send or receive any payments itself.

### Inclusions and Limitations

The simulator will execute payments on the mocked out network as it 
would for a network of real nodes. See the inclusions and exclusions 
listed below for a description of the functionality covered by the 
simulated network.

Included: 
* Routing Policy Enforcement: mocked channels enforce fee and CLTV 
  requirements.
* Channel restrictions: mocked channels abide by the in-flight 
  count and value limitations set on channel creation.
* Liquidity checks: HTLCs are only forwarded if the node has sufficient
  liquidity in the mocked channel.

Not included: 
* Channel reserve: the required minimum reserve balance is not 
  subtracted from a node's available balance.
* On chain fees: the simulation does not subtract on chain fees from 
  available liquidity.
* Dust limits: the simulation node not account for restrictions on dust
  HTLCs.
